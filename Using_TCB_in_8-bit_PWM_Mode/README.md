 # Using TCB in 8-bit PWM mode

This program shows how to configure the Timer/Counter Type B (TCB) to obtain a PWM signal with 50% duty cycle and one second period and to output it on a pin, in this case, the on-board LED.

## Setup
The ATMEGA4809 Xplained Pro Development Board is used as test platform.

The following configurations must be made for this project:

<Configurations>

System clock is set to Internal 32 kHz Ultra Low-Power Oscillator and the prescaler is set to 64.

TCB3:
- Clock Selection: Main clock divided by 2
- Period in CCMP register set to 0x80FF (the PWM signal period is controlled by the CCMPH, while CCMPL controls the duty cycle of the waveform)
- TCB mode is 8-bit PWM mode
- Output on pin enabled

| Pin |  Configuration    |
| :-: | :---------------: |
| PB5 |   Digital output  |

 ## Operation

This image shows the PWM signal generated by the TCB3 instance. The waveform period is 1s and its duty cycle is 50%.


## Summary

This code example shows how to initialize the TCB in 8-bit PWM mode to generate a PWM signal with a period of 1 second and 50% duty cycle.
